# LogicProgramming Project
Using Kanren Package\
Programming Language:\
Python \
This project uses Python Kanren Package to create a programming project using logic programming.\
Since logic programming is a based on formal logic there is a set of sentences in formal logic form that are expressing pacts and rules about a specific domain.\
I created a week schedule that included class and work times for each day of my week.\
This includes a formal logic that relates the days of the week to jobs both work and school as well as a connection between school and work to that of specific times of the day. This creates a connection between day and times allowing me direct access to specific information in bilateral directions.
